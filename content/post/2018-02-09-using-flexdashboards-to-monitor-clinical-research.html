<p>Much of my work involves prospective clinical research, where data collection can take months or years to complete and relies on continuous effort from multidisciplinary teams. Throughout the study, we monitor progress in various ways, such as…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rates of enrollment and reasons for patient exclusion</strong>, to make sure our study pace is on target and the cohort reflects the population we intended to study</li>
<li><strong>Open-label medication use</strong>, to make sure we can draw reliable conclusions about the <em>actual</em> difference between our treatments</li>
<li><strong>Key aspects of the study protocol</strong>, such as making sure study devices are worn consistently</li>
<li><strong>Follow-up rates</strong>, to alert us when we need new strategies to maintain contact with patients and their families over years of follow-up</li>
</ul>
<p>In previous studies, our <a href="icudelirium.org">critical care research organization</a> used weekly PDF reports created in <code>knitr</code>/LaTeX to monitor study progress. While helpful, their length and detail tend to bury our most important metrics amid numbers that we only need occasionally. For our most recent study, I created a <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">flexdashboard</a> which summarizes our most important metrics of study progress in a way that</p>
<ul>
<li>Gives us a quick, clear overview of what’s happening;</li>
<li>Provides additional detail as needed via interactive graphics; and</li>
<li>Updates on every run by accessing our <a href="https://projectredcap.org">database</a> API.</li>
</ul>
<p>The entire project can be found in <a href="https://github.com/jenniferthompson/MOSAICProgress">this Github repo</a>; it includes an <code>.Rmd</code> file for the actual dashboard which sources a <code>.R</code> script for data preparation.</p>
<div id="study-background" class="section level2">
<h2>Study Background</h2>
<p>The MOSAIC (Measuring OutcomeS of Activity in Intensive Care) study will evaluate the relationship between patients’ activity levels during their ICU stay and their disability, physical function, and cognition up to a year after their critical illness. More information on the study can be found on <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03115840">clinicaltrials.gov</a>.</p>
<p>We started data collection in March 2017, and will eventually enroll 312 patients from the Vanderbilt ICUs. As patient enrollment and follow-up continue, we want to monitor rates of screening, enrollment, and follow-up and to make sure that key study data is being collected while patients are in the hospital. Enter the flexdashboard!</p>

<h2>Flexdashboard Primer for the Unfamiliar</h2>
<p>RMarkdown, saved with the <code>.Rmd</code> extension, allows us to interweave R code with Markdown text and create output in HTML, PDF, and other formats. flexdashboards are a specific type of HTML output which emphasizes data visualizations. Use your <code>.Rmd</code> YAML to specify this output type and set a few options:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: &quot;MOSAIC Study Progress&quot;

  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    orientation: columns
    vertical_layout: fill
    theme: cosmo
    logo: favicon_48x48.png
    favicon: favicon_48x48.png
---</code></pre>
<p>If you use RStudio, flexdashboards are also available as an RMarkdown template when you create a new file. RStudio’s <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">flexdashboard page</a> has more!</p>
<p>Flexdashboards can include interactive components using <a href="shiny.rstudio.com">Shiny</a>. That level of interactivity wouldn’t add much value for our single-center study, and I wanted to be able to send a static file to our team (vs requiring an internet connection), so we stick to the simpler non-Shiny version. For multicenter studies, I think using Shiny or <a href="https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/">trelliscopejs</a> have a lot of potential for looking at overall numbers as well as individual site metrics.</p>
</div>
<div id="particularly-helpful-features" class="section level2">
<h2>Particularly Helpful Features</h2>
<p>Rather than repeat how-to information you can find in the very helpful flexdashboard docs, I’ll highlight some features and capabilities I’ve found particularly useful in the context of clinical research monitoring.</p>
<div id="separate-pages-for-separate-topics" class="section level3">
<h3>Separate Pages for Separate Topics</h3>
<p>Most of our studies are divided into three phases, each conducted by different teams within our group. Having one flexdashboard page per phase helps each team quickly focus attention on the most relevant metrics for their work. It’s easy to do using Markdown headers:</p>
<pre><code>Screening &amp; Enrollment
=====================================

In-Hospital
=====================================

Follow-Up
=====================================

Study &amp; Technical Info
=====================================
</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="interactive-graphics" class="section level3">
<h3>Interactive Graphics</h3>
<p>There are quite a few ways to incorporate interactive graphics into a flexdashboard (see <a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org/"><code>htmlwidgets</code></a> for one great list of options); thus far, I’ve mainly used <a href="https://plotly-book.cpsievert.me/"><code>plotly</code></a>, which has allowed us to focus on the big picture quickly while incorporating detailed information in tooltips. For example, we have 17 separate reasons for study exclusion, and want to track how these change over time. Using text or legends to denote which line is which exclusion would take up valuable screen real estate; by including that information in tooltips instead, we can access that information only when we need it. <code>plotly</code>’s zoom capabilities are also really helpful for investigating data points more closely.</p>
</div>
<div id="hierarchical-treemaps-with-the-treemap-and-highcharter-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Hierarchical Treemaps with the <code>treemap</code> and <code>highcharter</code> Packages</h3>
<p>Treemaps are another useful way for us to quickly get an overview of some piece of study information, then drill down for more detail as needed. For example, we’ve grouped our 17 exclusions into a few major categories. A quick look at our treemap gives us a great <em>broad</em> sense of why patients are being excluded. If we’re curious about what <em>specific</em> medical reasons are excluding patients, for example, we can drill down and see those details.</p>

<div id="progress-indicators-with-gauges" class="section level3">
<h3>Progress Indicators with <code>gauge</code>s</h3>
<p><img style="float:right; padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;width:200px;height:123px" src="/images/flexdash_gauge.png"" alt = "gauge example""></p>
<p>Flexdashboard comes with several built-in widgets; one is the <code>gauge</code>, which we use to mark progress in study enrollment. It’s a quick, informative way to see how far we’ve come in hitting our enrollment target.</p>
</div>
<div id="warning-signs-with-valueboxes-and-conditional-coloring" class="section level3">
<h3>Warning Signs with <code>valueBox</code>es and Conditional Coloring</h3>
<p><img style="float:right; padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;width:200px;height:31px" src="/images/flexdash_valuebox.png"" alt = "valueBox example""></p>
<p>flexdashboard’s <code>valueBox</code> widget works well for either positive reinforcement or for warning us when something goes below a specified target. For example, the primary exposure in our study is level of activity in the ICU; one way we measure this is via accelerometers patients wear on their wrist and ankle (think an industrial FitBit). When our <code>valueBox</code> goes from green to orange, we know that we need to communicate with our in-hospital team to address barriers to wearing the devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="nice-tabular-printing" class="section level3">
<h3>Nice Tabular Printing</h3>
<p>Our current dashboard uses <code>knitr::kable</code> for one small table and <code>DT::datatable</code> for a larger one. If this study were a randomized clinical trial in which we needed to monitor open-label drug use, <code>DT</code> would be a great way to list all open-label doses in a searchable, sortable, paginated format - much better than the pages of Latex tables in our previous reports!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="dashboards-communication" class="section level2">
<h2>Dashboards != Communication</h2>
<p>Building this dashboard has been (and continues to be!) an iterative process, based on the needs of our various teams. <strong>It is meant to facilitate communication, not to replace it.</strong> No matter how snazzy it looks, a dashboard isn’t informative at all if the user doesn’t have the background and knowledge they need to interpret it, or if it’s not giving information that can lead to action. Our immediate goal with this dashboard is to alert us quickly to anything going on that warrants either corrective action or positive reinforcement. This in turn helps us get to our ultimate goal: to produce the strongest research possible, which will advance science and improve the experiences of critically ill patients and their loved ones.</p>
</div>
