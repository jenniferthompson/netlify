*This post accompanies my [talk](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/wsds/2018/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?AbstractID=304811) at the 2018 [Women in Statistics & Data Science](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/wsds/2018/) conference ([full slide deck](https://github.com/jenniferthompson/WSDS2018)). The header photo was taken while enjoying some snacks and beverages on a hill in Tuscany on a spring afternoon, and it represents the serenity I want all of us to feel about these project management tasks. #goals*

I‚Äôm currently the primary biostatistician working with a group of over ten principal clinical investigators. That means lots of projects and lots of people
with conflicting timelines and priorities.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/biostatlifecycle-min.png")
```

There‚Äôs a fantastic team involved all along the way - but the stats team is
often deeply involved at *every* step. This is often true for corporate data
science as well: there are business stakeholders involved at some points, domain
experts or infrastructure teams at other points, but the data scientist is there
for the entire timeline.

Since we‚Äôre *involved* at every step, we often *manage* these steps, at least in
part: juggling timelines of multiple stakeholders, making decisions based on
information from data entry or infrastructure teams, creating more efficient
processes, and keeping track of progress and following up on tasks needed for us
to move forward. In short...

**‚Ä¶if there is no formal project manager, often WE become a project manager.**

This has advantages! We have a deeper knowledge of the data, the project, and
the domain, and build stronger relationships with the infrastructure or data
entry team as well as the stakeholders. This leads to more rigorous analysis,
more relevant interpretation of results, and more effective communication of the
clinical or business impact. Plus many of us genuinely enjoy this work! I love
the sense of collaboration and ownership I feel when I‚Äôm this deeply involved in
a project.

As any project manager will tell you, though, project management (PM) is a lot
of work. And if time doing PM work takes away from technical work or development, it might actually hold us back professionally.^[Tanya Reilly has a fantastic [talk](https://www.slideshare.net/TanyaReilly/being-glue) on doing this ‚Äúglue work‚Äù as a software engineer; a lot of it is applicable to us as data scientists as well. Thanks to Sharla Gelfand for sharing this talk!] So it's in our
interest to manage our projects efficiently!

Our stats team have developed some successful PM strategies for our context.
Your mileage may vary; I hope you‚Äôll take these ideas and tweak them to work in
your specific context.

# Communication

When I first started working with our research group, I would get individual,
uncoordinated requests from each investigator. As an inexperienced new employee
who wanted to make everyone happy, this was a difficult situation. We now have a
weekly meeting of primary stakeholders - in our case, the biostats team and all
the principal investigators. This is incredibly helpful for getting our team on
the same page and coordinating our priorities and timelines. It also allows
team members to learn from one another: our research fellows learn how to work
with the statistical team by watching how we interact with the more senior PIs,
and the biostatisticians learn about the clinical background and impact of each
project.

We also keep a list of priorities available to everyone in the group, so all
the stakeholders know what projects are on my list and have a sense of when I
might get to them. This also facilitates conversations about changing priorities
or timelines. (We keep it simple and do this via a Slack channel that I update
weekly.)

# Focus

What are your group‚Äôs goals? Revenue, grants, patient care - you can have
several, of course, but delineating them "out loud" gives you criteria for which
projects to take on and which should take a backseat. Our group is full of
fantastic ideas, but we've absolutely had learning experiences where we spent time on a project that never quite got done (or got done... eventually), because
it turns out those projects weren't really getting us to our goals at that
moment. It happens to the best of us, and we can learn from those experiences.

Once you‚Äôve determined a project is worth taking on, and you‚Äôve defined its initial goals, we all need to watch out for [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep). Scope creep might sound like
‚Äúas long as you‚Äôre in that database, can you look at these other things too?‚Äù Or
‚ÄúWait, what happens if we do it THIS way?!‚Äù These can be great ideas worth incorporating! But sometimes they just derail us from our mission. Creating a
plan, and then *documenting* the inevitable changes to your plan, is incredibly helpful for setting your intention; for making sure everyone understands the goals and methods of the project; and for outlining the steps that will help
your team get to your goal.^[In our context, we‚Äôve successfully used our statistical analysis plan to handle this. We recently had a major clinical trial [published](https://nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1808217); particularly in
that scenario, the SAP is a big deal, and we [registered ours publicly](https://osf.io/mq38r) so that it‚Äôs clear that we didn‚Äôt do any manipulation of our outcomes after we knew the treatment assignments. One added
advantage of that formal registration: Whenever one of us got an idea for
additional analysis while we were working on the primary manuscript, we were
able to collectively say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great idea. We‚Äôd have to update the SAP, and
it would be after we broke the blind. Is it important enough for that?‚Äù And in
this case, the answer was always no. :) Keeping that project focused using the
SAP meant we were able to publish our work efficiently, without being derailed
by interesting but secondary side questions. The most important ideas will come back up in later discussion, and we‚Äôll develop a thoughtful plan for them then.]

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/planvc.png")
```

Of course, having the best plan in the world doesn‚Äôt help if you can‚Äôt actually execute it. There are many weeks when I come into work thinking I know exactly what I‚Äôll be working on, and end the week wondering just exactly where it went. (üôã if you feel me.) Getting ‚Äúdistracted‚Äù by smaller, one-off requests can be
not only frustrating for the analyst, but keep the team from focusing on our primary goals.

We‚Äôve instituted a system inspired by software development strategies: I spend two weeks of my time working on ‚Äúmajor‚Äù projects that require lots of focus and move us toward our group goals, and the next week on important but smaller
projects that can be stacked and done in batches. These might look like those
‚Äúhey, can you tell me how many people‚Ä¶‚Äù requests, or journal revisions, or tweaking visualizations.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/focusadhoc-min.png")
```

We‚Äôve been using this system for about six months now; it has allowed us to push a major project through to publication in a reasonable time frame (with a much
happier biostatistician), while still allowing the daily business of clinical research to take place. In short, I‚Äôm a big fan.

As some audience members at WSDS rightfully pointed out, this is difficult to do if you‚Äôre in a situation where you have multiple stakeholders who *aren‚Äôt* coordinating with each other. (A typical academic statistician often has her
time split between several unrelated projects. How do you execute this ‚Äúfocus vs
ad hoc‚Äù approach for a project that only funds 17% of your effort, with work required in bursts, and is with a PI who doesn‚Äôt communicate with any of your other PIs?) That‚Äôs a tough question I haven‚Äôt solved. If anyone has great ideas, I‚Äôll happily link to them here!

# Process

In your typical project, who is involved in **making decisions** about analysis
plans or communication strategies? Hopefully we, the data people, are, along
with the primary stakeholders. There might be additional stakeholders - mentors
or supervisors. Maybe we have a database team or other infrastructure folks who
help decide about data storage. Maybe we have a statistical colleague with
expertise in a particular area‚Ä¶ maybe we have a C-suite or a department chair we
need to make happy. (You see where I'm going with this.) Eventually, there are
many people in the metaphorical room, and we think every decision needs to be
run by all of them. This creates confusion, not consensus.

Enter the [RACI matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix), which helps streamline decision-making processes. For any given task,
define who is **responsible** for executing the task; who is ultimately
**accountable** for the task; who is **consulted** on decisions related to the
task; and who is simply **informed** about those decisions.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/raciexample-min.png")
```

Knowing the core team responsible for a specific task means we know who to
include in each decision. This means we don‚Äôt miss getting input from key team
members, and don‚Äôt spend time waiting on consensus from the people who aren‚Äôt
directly involved. We haven‚Äôt gone through this formal process with the whole
team, but even using it as a framework for individual projects or tasks has been
immensely helpful.

We‚Äôve also recently started using a project request form for new statistical projects, which helps us learn:

- The reason/goal for the project,
- Who is *accountable* for the project, + additional team members who will help
steer it
- Logistical information (always deadlines!; in our context, that also includes [IRB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board) permissions, any
manuscript drafts or table shells that are already written, and funding/data sources)

This information helps us prioritize, streamline, and keep an eye out for any
logistical hurdles we need to overcome before starting analysis or planning.

We‚Äôre also working on onboarding documents for new team members, with
information like how and when to contact the biostats team; where our documents
and data are stored; and what we expect both of our investigators and of
ourselves. We hope that collecting all this information in one spot will be
useful for our new clinical and statistical team members, and help emphasize
that we‚Äôre all on the same team with the same goals. TBD!

# Systemic Considerations

It‚Äôs important to understand what is valued by your organization and the career
path that you‚Äôre on - and to know what *you* value! If you‚Äôre in an academic tenure track position, for example, most likely no one on your promotion
committee is asking you how efficiently your collaborators‚Äô first author papers
were written, and thus it doesn‚Äôt make sense to spend a lot of your time on
these tasks - but they may be highly valued in a different position or organization. Understanding what will move *you* forward and what you enjoy is key to meeting your own professional goals as well as your team's.

If you‚Äôre a manager or a supervisor, *please* be aware of how much
[‚Äúglue work‚Äù](https://www.slideshare.net/TanyaReilly/being-glue) your employees
are doing! A lot of us in data work are collaborative by nature, aiming to be
helpful and fix inefficiencies. That is valuable to our teams, but if we‚Äôre
spending "too much" time on tasks (PM or otherwise) that won‚Äôt be considered by those doing the promoting or hiring, it will hurt us long-term. New employees
aren't always in the best position to know what "too much" looks like in their
organization, and supervisors can provide resources and valuable calibration.

# Recognition & Thanks!

- The [VUMC Strategy & Innovation Office](https://ww2.mc.vanderbilt.edu/strategyandinnovation/) has some great training workshops including some on project management, which is where I
learned some of these techniques. If you‚Äôre at a large organization, I‚Äôd highly
recommend looking into similar options!
- My supervisor [Rameela Chandrasekhar](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/RameelaChandrasekhar) has been a hugely supportive teammate and collaborator in developing and supporting these practices!
- Many thanks to [Jesse Mostipak](https://www.jessemaegan.com/) and [Sharla Gelfand](https://sharlagelfand.netlify.com/) who helped make sure this talk/post would apply to all data folks, not just those in academic environments.
