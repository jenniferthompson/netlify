<p>I recently had the privilege of teaching three days of <a href="../../../../resources/">workshops</a> in Japan. I had a fantastic trip, and a <a href="https://twitter.com/jent103/status/1004341326979088386">great experience</a> with the team at Osaka City University.</p>
<p>This story, however, is about the days before.</p>
<div id="the-scenario" class="section level2">
<h2>The Scenario</h2>
<p>The workshops were full of new teaching material. Due partially to hesitation about putting very in-progress work online, and mostly to doing lots of work on planes and in other wifi-less situations, my Github commits were rare in the months leading up to my visit, but I took an uncharacteristically laissez-faire attitude toward the situation. I mean, I know bad things happen, but they’ve never happened to <em>me</em>…</p>
<p>I knew, though. In the back of my head, I knew.</p>

<p>Fortunately no one did mug me that night in Seattle, but Miles McBain’s recent <a href="https://milesmcbain.xyz/how-to-survive-a-laptop-fire/">blog post</a> (and other well known <a href="https://github.com/MilesMcBain/gistfo">thoughts on the matter</a>) were fresh in my mind, and I swore to do better. You know, just in case.</p>
<p>I finished the last workshop slides on my flight to Tokyo; because I am <del>cheap</del> frugal, I did not purchase the $20, probably slow, airplane wifi. No one was in the seat next to me (#blessed), so after finishing the slides I set my laptop there while I ate and watched yet another movie<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. At some point, the laptop slid to the floor. “No big deal,” I thought. “It’s not that far a drop, and it didn’t hit that hard.” I had a brief series of heart palpitations when the machine took a few minutes to wake up before landing, but eventually it did, and I proceeded to forget about it. When I got to my hotel, I committed the last changes to Github… <em>just in case.</em></p>
<p>Thirty-six hours passed, during which my traveling companions and I 1) ate plenty of raw seafood and 2) noticed no issues with the laptop. The next morning, as we were packing to head to Kyoto, I went to shut it down. I logged in, and then…</p>
<p>…the screen started flickering.</p>
<p>Badly.</p>
<p>Then the screen went <strong>black</strong>.</p>
<p>The rest of the machine seemed to be okay, but no amount of hitting keys or trying to restart was bringing my screen back.</p>

<h2>The Lessons</h2>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Friends, the <em>only</em> thing saving me from panic at this point was knowing that, in a pinch, I had a <strong>minimum viable set of materials on Github that I could run from <em>anyone’s</em> computer, with no prep.</strong> They wouldn’t be perfect (I was planning some last-minute updates after conversations with the OCU team), and I might not be able to run the examples myself and or do any live coding, but they would do.</p>
<p>Choose your own source - Dropbox, Google Drive, whichever - but for the love, <em>put it online</em>. In my case, Github worked perfectly: My slides were HTML (done with <a href="https://github.com/yihui/xaringan"><code>xaringan</code></a>), and I had enabled Github Pages on those repos, so that I could walk up to any computer with internet access and immediately start the workshops.</p>
<p>(A less dramatic situation happened last summer, when I gave a <a href="https://github.com/jenniferthompson/ADS2017">talk on missing data and bias</a>. Everyone had sent slides prior to the conference, but mine didn’t make it onto the ballroom computer - which I didn’t realize until I went to the lectern to speak. I went to my Github repo, downloaded the PDF, and moved on with the talk in about a minute. Minor catastrophe and awkward conference technical difficulties averted, because the work was easily accessible online.)</p></li>
<li><p>I had two friends traveling with me; they were amazingly chill about spending part of their Japanese vacation going to the Apple Store in Ginza<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and one even spent the next morning accompanying me to Osaka to troubleshoot. Select excellent travel companions, is what I’m saying.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So. Put your work online. The worst case scenario probably won’t happen… <em>but it could</em>.</p>

<div id="epilogue" class="section level2">
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>I let the OCU team know the situation, and the next morning I went over to Osaka to figure out a solution that would allow me to make updates over the next few days, as I had just been given access to their EDC system. Upon arriving at OCU and plugging my laptop into an external monitor…</p>
<p>…the <strong>whole thing worked</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s like it never happened.</p>
<p>I type this post to you now on the very same laptop, looking at the very same screen.</p>
<p>I can’t explain this. Did the Universe want to teach me a lesson, and once I was sufficiently frightened, it generously gave me my laptop back? Is there some wire that got jolted loose and then back into place? ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>
<p>I left OCU with a spare HDMI cable to use with the hotel TV should the need arise. But the need never did; I finished my updates on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen">Shinkansen</a> (pushing those changes to Github via our pocket wifi, because I have learned my lesson), and the only technical difficulties during our workshops were the ones caused by actual code.</p>
<p>But this is a mystery, and one I wouldn’t count on repeating.</p>
